  This demo demonstrates fast drawing of noise patches via use of
  procedural texture mapping. It only works on hardware with support for
  the GLSL shading language, vertex- and fragment-shaders.
 
  Patches are not encoded into a texture, but instead a little algorithm -
  a procedural texture shader - is executed on the graphics processor
  (GPU). This is very fast and efficient! All parameters of the patch can
  be set individually.
 
  This demo is both, a speed benchmark, and a correctness test. If executed
  with the optional benchmark flag set to 2, it will execute a loop where
  it repeatedly draws a patch on the GPU and then reads back the noise
  patch and computes a histogram over all pixels, so you can verify if the
  noise distribution is what you expect.
 
  In benchmark mode (flag set to 1), the patch is drawn as fast as
  possible, testing the maximum rate at which your system can draw patchs.
 
  At a default setting of benchmark==0, it just shows nicely drawn patch.
 
  Please note that results in performance and accuracy *will* vary,
  depending on the model of your graphics card, gfx-driver version and
  possibly operating system. For consistent results, always check before
  you measure on different setups! However, the more recent the graphics
  card, the faster and more accurate -- the latest generation of cards is
  supposed to be "just perfect" for vision research...
 
  If you want to draw many patches per frame, you wouldn't do it like in
  this script, but use the batch-drawing version of Screen('DrawTextures',
  ...) instead, as demonstrated, e.g., in DrawingSpeedTest.m. That way you
  could submit the specs (parameters) of all patches in one single matrix
  via one single Screen('DrawTextures'); call - this is more efficient and
  therefore extra fast!</pre></div><!--after help -->
