              Allows vertical scrolling through channels and manual marking 
              and unmarking of data stretches or epochs for rejection.
  Usage: 
            &gt;&gt; eegplot(data, 'key1', value1 ...); % use interface buttons, etc.
       else
            &gt;&gt; eegplot('noui', data, 'key1', value1 ...); % no user interface;
                                                          % use for plotting
  Menu items:
     "Figure &gt; print" - [menu] Print figure in portrait or landscape.
     "Figure &gt; Edit figure" - [menu] Remove menus and buttons and call up the standard
                   Matlab figure menu. Select "Tools &gt; Edit" to format the figure
                   for publication. Command line equivalent: 'noui' 
     "Figure &gt; Accept and Close" - [menu] Same as the bottom-right "Reject" button. 
     "Figure &gt; Cancel and Close" - [menu] Cancel all editing, same as the "Cancel" button. 
     "Display &gt; Marking color" &gt; [Hide|Show] marks" - [menu] Show or hide patches of 
                   background color behind the data. Mark stretches of *continuous* 
                   data (e.g., for rejection) by dragging the mouse horizontally 
                   over the activity. With *epoched* data, click on the selected epochs.
                   Clicked on a marked region to unmark it. Called from the
                   command line, marked data stretches or epochs are returned in 
                   the TMPREJ variable in the global workspace *if/when* the "Reject" 
                   button is pressed (see Outputs); called from pop_eegplot() or 
                   eeglab(), the marked data portions are removed from the current
                   dataset, and the dataset is automatically updated.
      "Display &gt; Marking color &gt; Choose color" - [menu] Change the background marking 
                   color. The marking color(s) of previously marked trials are preserved. 
                   Called from command line, subsequent functions eegplot2event() or 
                   eegplot2trials() allow processing trials marked with different colors 
                   in the TMPREJ output variable. Command line equivalent: 'wincolor'.
      "Display &gt; Grid &gt; ..." - [menu] Toggle (on or off) time and/or channel axis grids 
                   in the activity plot. Submenus allow modifications to grid aspects.
                   Command line equivalents: 'xgrid' / 'ygrid' 
      "Display &gt; Show scale" - [menu] Show (or hide if shown) the scale on the bottom 
                   right corner of the activity window. Command line equivalent: 'scale' 
      "Display &gt; Title" - [menu] Change the title of the figure. Command line equivalent: 
                   'title'
      "Settings &gt; Time range to display"  - [menu] For continuous EEG data, this item 
                   pops up a query window for entering the number of seconds to display
                   in the activity window. For epoched data, the query window asks
                   for the number of epochs to display (this can be fractional). 
                   Command line equivalent: 'winlength'
      "Settings &gt; Number of channels to display" - [menu] Number of channels to display
                   in the activity window.  If not all channels are displayed, the 
                   user may scroll through channels using the slider on the left 
                   of the activity plot. Command line equivalent: 'dispchans'
      "Settings &gt; Channel labels &gt; ..."  - [menu] Use numbers as channel labels or load
                   a channel location file from disk. If called from the eeglab() menu or
                   pop_eegplot(), the channel labels of the dataset will be used. 
                   Command line equivalent: 'eloc_file'
      "Settings &gt; Zoom on/off" - [menu] Toggle Matlab figure zoom on or off for time and
                   electrode axes. left-click to zoom (x2); right-click to reverse-zoom. 
                   Else, draw a rectange in the activity window to zoom the display into 
                   that region. NOTE: When zoom is on, data cannot be marked for rejection.
      "Settings &gt; Events" - [menu] Toggle event on or off (assuming events have been 
                   given as input). Press "legend" to pop up a legend window for events.
 
  Display window interface:
     "Activity plot" - [main window] This axis displays the channel activities.  For 
                   continuous data, the time axis shows time in seconds. For epoched
                   data, the axis label indicate time within each epoch.
     "Cancel" - [button] Closes the window and cancels any data rejection marks.
     "Event types" - [button] pop up a legend window for events.
     "&lt;&lt;" - [button] Scroll backwards though time or epochs by one window length.
     "&lt;"  - [button] Scroll backwards though time or epochs by 0.2 window length.
     "Navigation edit box" - [edit box] Enter a starting time or epoch to jump to.
     "&gt;"  - [button] Scroll forward though time or epochs by 0.2 window length.
     "&gt;&gt;" - [button] Scroll forward though time or epochs by one window length.
     "Chan/Time/Value" - [text] If the mouse is within the activity window, indicates
                   which channel, time, and activity value the cursor is closest to.
     "Scale edit box" - [edit box] Scales the displayed amplitude in activity units.
                   Command line equivalent: 'spacing' 
     "+ / -" - [buttons] Use these buttons to +/- the amplitude scale by 10%. 
     "Reject" - [button] When pressed, save rejection marks and close the figure. 
                   Optional input parameter 'command' is evaluated at that time. 
                   NOTE: This button's label can be redefined from the command line
                   (see 'butlabel' below). If no processing command is specified
                   for the 'command' parameter (below), this button does not appear.
     "Stack/Spread" - [button] "Stack" collapses all channels/activations onto the
                   middle axis of the plot. "Spread" undoes the operation.
     "Norm/Denorm" - [button] "Norm" normalizes each channel separately such that all
                   channels have the same standard deviation without changing original 
                   data/activations under EEG structure. "Denorm" undoes the operation.  
                  
  Required command line input:
     data        - Input data matrix, either continuous 2-D (channels,timepoints) or 
                   epoched 3-D (channels,timepoints,epochs). If the data is preceded 
                   by keyword 'noui', GUI control elements are omitted (useful for 
                   plotting data for presentation). A set of power spectra at
                   each channel may also be plotted (see 'freqlimits' below).
  Optional command line keywords:
     'srate'      - Sampling rate in Hz {default|0: 256 Hz}
     'spacing'    - Display range per channel (default|0: max(whole_data)-min(whole_data))
     'eloc_file'  - Electrode filename (as in  &gt;&gt; topoplot example) to read
                     ascii channel labels. Else,
                    [vector of integers] -&gt; Show specified channel numbers. Else,
                    [] -&gt; Do not show channel labels {default|0 -&gt; Show [1:nchans]}
     'limits'     - [start end] Time limits for data epochs in ms (for labeling 
                    purposes only).
     'freqlimits' - [start end] If plotting epoch spectra instead of data, frequency 
                    limits of the display. (Data should contain spectral values).
     'winlength'  - [value] Seconds (or epochs) of data to display in window {default: 5}
     'dispchans'  - [integer] Number of channels to display in the activity window 
                    {default: from data}.  If &lt; total number of channels, a vertical  
                    slider on the left side of the figure allows vertical data scrolling. 
     'title'      - Figure title {default: none}
     'xgrid'      - ['on'|'off'] Toggle display of the x-axis grid {default: 'off'}

     'ploteventdur' - ['on'|'off'] Toggle display of event duration { default: 'off' }
     'data2'      - [float array] identical size to the original data and
                    plotted on top of it.
 
  Additional keywords:
     'command'    - ['string'] Matlab command to evaluate when the 'REJECT' button is 
                    clicked. The 'REJECT' button is visible only if this parameter is 
                    not empty. As explained in the "Output" section below, the variable 
                    'TMPREJ' contains the rejected windows (see the functions 
                    eegplot2event() and eegplot2trial()).
     'butlabel'   - Reject button label. {default: 'REJECT'}
     'winrej'     - [start end R G B e1 e2 e3 ...] Matrix giving data periods to mark 
                     for rejection, each row indicating a different period
                       [start end] = period limits (in frames from beginning of data); 
                       [R G B] = specifies the marking color; 
                       [e1 e2 e3 ...] = a (1,nchans) logical [0|1] vector giving 
                          channels (1) to mark and (0) not mark for rejection.
     'color'      - ['on'|'off'|cell array] Plot channels with different colors.
                    If an RGB cell array {'r' 'b' 'g'}, channels will be plotted 
                    using the cell-array color elements in cyclic order {default:'off'}. 
     'wincolor'   - [color] Color to use to mark data stretches or epochs {default: 
                    [ 0.7 1 0.9] is the default marking color}
     'events'     - [struct] EEGLAB event structure (EEG.event) to use to show events.
     'submean'    - ['on'|'off'] Remove channel means in each window {default: 'on'}
     'position'   - [lowleft_x lowleft_y width height] Position of the figure in pixels.
     'tag'        - [string] Matlab object tag to identify this eegplot() window (allows 
                     keeping track of several simultaneous eegplot() windows). 
     'children'   - [integer] Figure handle of a *dependent* eegplot() window. Scrolling
                     horizontally in the master window will produce the same scroll in 
                     the dependent window. Allows comparison of two concurrent datasets,
                     or of channel and component data from the same dataset.
     'scale'      - ['on'|'off'] Display the amplitude scale {default: 'on'}.
     'mocap'      - ['on'|'off'] Display motion capture data in a separate figure.
                      To run, select an EEG data period in the scolling display using 
                      the mouse. Motion capture (mocap) data should be
                      under EEG.moredata.mocap.markerPosition in xs, ys and zs fields which are
                      (number of markers, number of time points) arrays.                
                     {default: 'off'}.
     'selectcommand' - [cell array] list of 3 commands (strings) to run when the mouse 
                       button is down, when it is moving and when the mouse button is up.
     'ctrlselectcommand' - [cell array] same as above in conjunction with pressing the 
                       CTRL key.
  Outputs:
     TMPREJ       -  Matrix (same format as 'winrej' above) placed as a variable in
                     the global workspace (only) when the REJECT button is clicked. 
                     The command specified in the 'command' keyword argument can use 
                     this variable. (See eegplot2trial() and eegplot2event()).
